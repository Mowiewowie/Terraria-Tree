# TerrariTree 🌳✨
We all know the Terraria Wiki is legendary, but sometimes finding a complex crafting path feels like a deep-dive expedition. I got tired of clicking through five different wiki links and google searches just to see the crafting details, so I decided to build a tool that puts it all in one place.

**TerrariTree** is a modern, interactive visualizer that makes navigating recipes feel as smooth as the game itself. It’s **vibe-coded with a little help from Gemini**, focusing on a sleek UI that stays out of your way while you're playing.

### 📱 Take it Anywhere
Whether you're playing on PC and have your phone open next to you, or you're playing the mobile version of Terraria, this app is **fully mobile-optimized**. It feels like a native app on your phone, so you can check recipes without having to minimize your game.

### 🛠️ What it actually does

* **Interactive, Nested Trees:** Instead of static tables, you get a fully clickable tree. You can jump between tiers and materials instantly without waiting for a new wiki page to load. 🌿
* **The "What is this for?" Search:** If you find a weird material, just search for it. The app maps out every possible upgrade path for that item visually, so you know exactly what it's worth. 🔍
* **The Discovery Engine:** This is my favorite feature. You can input multiple items at once (like whatever is currently sitting in your chest) and the app will tell you exactly what you can craft using that *specific* combination of materials. 🧪
* **Built for Flow:** High-signal, low-friction. No cluttered ads or walls of text, just the data you need to get back to mining.

### 🎨 Why I built this
I've always wanted a tool like this, but I couldn't find it anywhere. In addition, I wanted to experiment with vibe-coding to see where this technology is today. I needed a way to make something like this that actually looked *good* and works well, without spending as much time as you normally would coding a tool like this. 

TerrariTree is the result of that. A project focused on taking the data we already have and making it much easier to explore and interact with. 

> *"Because your inventory shouldn't be a mystery, even 200 hours in."* 🍀

*Hope this helps you spend less time in menus and more time in the caves.* ⚔️
